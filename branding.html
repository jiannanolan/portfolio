They currently care for 19 properties supported by the public through donations of land, money & time.<br><br>The mobile app and complementary brochure utilizes logo recognition to improve the user experience and reduce sign clutter on the protected properties in order to maintain the properties’ natural integrity. In taking a digital avenue, notifications such as property notices (i.e. temporary closures) can be easily shared in real-time, improving communication between the organization and its supporters.<br><br>In such a saturated charity marketplace, awareness is extremely important to the success of the brand as companies rely on public support and donations. Through stronger use of the logo the brand gains an opportunity for the organization to use logo recognition in other print assets; improving community outreach as a whole, visability and support." %}
