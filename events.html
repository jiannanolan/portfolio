      {% pattern cards/information heading="Red Handed." text="A project inspired by the demand for true crime content in media, literature, podcasts and docu-series, Red Handed brings together true crime fanatics for a one-night conversation involving all things crime. Many true crime fans enjoy seeing this topic explored educationally and have a strong fascination with the darker side of humanity. With the help from renowned experts from psychological, forensic, and scientiﬁc backgrounds, the topic of crime, criminals, and the justice system will all be part of the broader discourse through riveting panels and discussions.<br><br>The design is heavily reﬂective of the true crime genre and the theme surrounding this convention. Through the use of an appropriate dark and edgy colour palette, a strong sense of moodiness is conveyed which showcases a serious yet approachable tone. Against the mono-chromatic palette, the striking shade of red is eye-catching. It is also representative of the name of the convention while corresponding visually to the logo and wordmark.<br><br>The feeling undertakes a more cinematic approach through layering various graphical elements and overlaying a grunge-like texture. The illustrations capture the methodology of crime; objects were selected in order to present this method rather than the use of imagery pertaining to a speciﬁc crime or a  depiction of violence in general. As this could be  sensitive subject matter, it was important to remain general with the imagery as to avoid exploiting a victim or to cause pain to someone who might have experienced a similar, traumatic event." %}
