For the last two years, I've worked as a junior graphic designer with the organization in creating a wide variety of work which can exist in both physical and digital spaces.<br><br>Creating assets for upcoming events to promote student life on campus was one of the many daily responsibilities. Within each project, the SA works closely with both internal and external clients to create unique and appropriate imagery for each event.<br><br>The main target audience is the student body attending Algonquin College. In these examples, the posters are printed and posted in common areas around campus to capture the students’ attention and garner a larger engagement. The illustrative quality and bright colour highlight a fun and exciting feeling while presenting important information in a clear and logical way." %}
