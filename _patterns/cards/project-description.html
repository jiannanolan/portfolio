    <p>A main objective of this design was to create new packaging that is more sustainable and reduces consumer waste. Within this goal the packaging must maintain its functionality and preserve the overall freshness and quality of the product while also appeal to its target audience who values health and nutrition. This demonstrates ability to thoroughly research the brand and understand the consumers needs and frustrations by applying an innovative solution to their current packaging</p>
