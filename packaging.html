      {% pattern cards/information heading="Sobey's Rebrand." text="The main objective of this design was to create new, sustainable packaging that reduces consumer waste. While the original packaging was made out of a hard plastic which was not good for the environment, the new packaging uses 100% compostable cardboard and a thin biodegradable lining.<br><br>These products are also affordable and appeal to a lower economic bracket, a working consumer and the on-the-go student. This type of product also targets an older generation’s taste palate and can be marketed towards seniors who do not cook anymore yet still live independently.<br><br>The design is colourful, welcoming, and warm and reﬂects Sobey’s mission of healthy living through natural and quality food as their slogan says “helping Canadians eat better, feel better and do better.” The imagery is sketch-like and portrays a homemade, vintage and nostalgic quality. The farm images convey a home-grown feel to the buyer presenting a narrative of how Sobey’s foods start at the farm conveying a simple and positive message." %}
