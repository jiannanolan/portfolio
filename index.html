      {% pattern cards/bio heading="Hello." text="My name is Jianna Nolan, I'm multidisciplinary designer with a strong Fine Arts background. Since a young age I've always been gravitated towards art as a way to make sense of the world. After completing my Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Ottawa in 2017, I wanted to expand my creative horizons by tackling a field that would challenge me in new and exciting ways. It wasn't long before I fell in love with design. Focused in illustration, branding, and marketing, my unwavering dedication to create quality design is mirrored by my ambition to push envelopes and find creative solutions." %}
