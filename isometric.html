      {% pattern cards/information heading="Isometrics." text="An isometric illustration uses pictures of objects in which all three dimensions are drawn at full-scale rather than foreshortening them to the true projection. This leaves an interesting perspective in which both simplicity and depth are intertwined. Utilizing this method of drawing, the objective of this project was to create an illustration which showcases a progression in time.<br><br>The design showcases an elementary school scene in which each room signifies a step in a childâ€™s day from the classroom to the playground, to lunch and then home again; little nuances and attention to detail was important in capturing this theme. This is demonstrated in the way the books are used as platform stages while bookmarks connect them together. The colour palette also reflects this theme as the colours used are bright, child-like, and playful mimicking what would be found in school." %}
