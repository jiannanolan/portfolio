      {% pattern cards/information heading="Book Cover Redesign." text="The objective of this project was to redesign three classic covers by author E.B White: Charlotte’s Web, Stuart Little, and The Trumpet of the Swan to improve their marketability. Through this new design, the books are sold as one cohesive collection captivating both lovers of the originals while simultaneously attracting a new generation of young readers.<br><br>Paying homage to the source material, each cover draws inspiration from within the book as the imagery and soft colour palette enhances the sweetness of the story’s message and reimagines iconic scenes in a new light.<br><br>Using innovative technology by means of a scannable tag, users are encouraged to download the audiobook which expands the reading experience into a modern space. This allows publishers to collaborate with a third-party company, track affiliate codes, and access a digital platform through which they can extend their advertising reach, increasing sales." %}
