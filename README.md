Ottawa-based Graphic Designer & Illustrator, Creative Thinker, Art Enthusiast & Lover Of All Things Shiny.

Raised in Ottawa the majority of my life, I’ve always had a passion for art, drawing and, most of all, creating. Upon completing my Bachelor of Fine Arts from the University of Ottawa, I discovered the world of design and my career path quickly shifted from one of uncertainty to one of deep purpose and joy.

I've always loved learning about new things and seeking challenges which push me out of my comfort zone as a designer. I believe those are when some of the best ideas come to fruition. Through design I feel great pride helping other brands and clients reach their full potential.
